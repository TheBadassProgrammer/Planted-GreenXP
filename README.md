## ðŸ“– Overview
This project implements an AI-powered image verification system to confirm that a tree or plant has been planted in a specified area. Users upload two images:

1. **Before Image** â€“ of the location before planting.
2. **After Image** â€“ of the same location after planting.

The system uses AI models and image processing techniques to verify that:

âœ” The two images are of the same area  
âœ” The area was free of plants in the first image  
âœ” A plant/tree is present in the second image  
âœ” The plant/tree is located in the same area as in the first image

## ðŸ“‚ How It Works

The process follows the flowchart below:

1. **Capture Before Image**  
   The user uploads an image of the area before planting.

2. **Plant Tree**  
   The user plants a tree or plant in the same location.

3. **Capture After Image**  
   The user uploads a second image of the same location after planting.

4. **Check Area Similarity**  
   Uses deep learning models such as VGG16, MobileNet, or DenseNet121 to compare the images.  
   If no match â†’ Reject request.  
   If match â†’ Proceed to next steps.  
   If unable to process â†’ Handle accordingly.

5. **Check if Plant is Absent in Image 1**  
   Uses object detection models like Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub to ensure no plant/tree is present.  
   If plant/tree is present â†’ Flag for fraud.  
   If absent â†’ Proceed.

6. **Check if Plant is Present in Image 2**  
   Uses object detection models to confirm the plant/tree is visible.  
   If absent â†’ Reject request.  
   If present â†’ Proceed.

7. **Check if Plant Location Overlaps Area**  
   Uses OpenCVâ€™s feature matching algorithms like ORB, SIFT, or AKAZE.  
   If overlap â†’ Verification passed!  
   If not overlap â†’ Flag for review.

## ðŸ“¦ Files

- **AI verification flowchart image** â€“ Visual representation of the workflow.
- **Backend service code** â€“ API endpoints for image upload and processing.
- **Frontend interface** â€“ Web application for user interaction.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment with required dependencies (`tensorflow`, `opencv-python`, `requests`, etc.).
3. Set the API keys (e.g., Hugging Face) in environment variables.
4. Run the backend service.
5. Access the frontend and upload images for verification.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
export HF_API_TOKEN="your_huggingface_api_token_here"
python main_override.py
```

## âš™ Configuration

Add your Hugging Face API token to an environment file:

```bash
HF_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token
```

Or export it directly:

```bash
export HF_API_TOKEN="your_actual_token"
```
